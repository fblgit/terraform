// Finder is a container type for various configuration settings and other
// metadata that we will use to locate, verify, and launch plugin components,
// which currently includes both providers and provisioners.
//
// The responsibility of this type includes both true plugins, where we start
// a child process and talk to it over gRPC, and also our various
// "pseudo-plugins" which really live directly inside the Terraform executable
// but which implement the same interfaces that Terraform Core expects for
// plugin components.
//
// Finder is not responsible for credentials helper plugins. The "svchost"
// functionality owns the overall problem of authenticating to Terraform-native
// services, which includes the idea of credentials helpers.
//
// The responsibility for configuring a Finder is unfortunately spread over
// multiple Terraform CLI subsystems, and so this type follows the Builder
// Pattern to allow gradually adding additional constraints when needed,
// such as layering on additional checksum verification when applying a saved
// plan in order to ensure that the plugins are identical to those which
// created the plan.
type Finder struct {
	// Providers and provisioners currently have a pretty different model
	// because providers kept moving forward to support the public registry,
	// private registries, etc while for provisioners we're just maintaining
	// the functionality as-is because they are not a mechanism we recommend
	// for new configurations.
	//
	// Unfortunately that means that this type is a bit of a two-headed
	// monster trying to make both of these appear somewhat similar to
	// callers. The configuration portions are quite distinct for each, but
	// the result for both is roughly the same: a set of factory functions
	// each responsible for verifying and launching a particular plugin.

	////// Provider-related data
	// providerDir is the object representing the directory where we keep
	// the local copies of provider plugins. The provider installer's job

	// is to verify that the directory contains the required set of plugins
	// and then, if so, to launch them as needed.

	// Core isn't aware that they are special.
	providerBuiltins map[string]providers.Factory
	// providerDevOverrides represents a set of plugins that are configured
	// in a special "dev override" mode, which means that the CLI configuration
	// specifies a fixed local directory to load from and we skip all of our
	// usual version and checksum verification. This mechanism is for provider
	// developers who want to use Terraform with as-yet-unpublished builds which
	// therefore don't have version numbers or finalized checksums yet.
	providerDevOverrides map[addrs.Provider]getproviders.PackageLocalDir
	// providersUnmanaged represents a set of plugins that Terraform doesn't
	// directly manage at all, and instead just expects to somehow already
	// be running. This is in some sense a more extreme version of
	// providerDevOverrides, and exists only to allow the plugin integration
	// test harness to make the provider's test process itself behave as an
	// already-running plugin server, respecting any special behavior set up by
	// the test program.

	// ensure that we're applying the plan with exactly the same plugins that
